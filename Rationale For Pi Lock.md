	The Pi Lock will allow tech crew members to enter the tech crew boothe without Mrs. Steetsâ€™ physical presence. 
	Mrs. Steets will remotely control who may and may not go into the booth. It will also create an audit trail, 
	detecting when the door is opened and closed. It will send notifications to Mrs. Steets to this effect.



Crew members will use usb keys as keys to enter the booth. Mrs. Steets has control over which usb keys are valid and when. 
Protections will be put in place to prevent multiple copies of one key. Mrs. Steets will always receive a text when a key is used,
and which key was used. If an invalid usb is inserted, its contents will be confiscated and Mrs. Steets will be notified.



The Pi Lock will be controlled over the internal school network through sFTP and ssh.



The Pi Lock will be inside the door, and a usb extension cord will run over the door and taped up. 
It will have a note explaining its purpose.



The Pi Lock will pull down the inside door knob (which is always unlocked) with a string via a servo.
This will not interfere with normal opening of the door. We may implement a feature in which the Pi Lock notifies 
Mrs. Steets anytime the door is opened manually (a sensor would be set up to monitor the door.)



In summary, the Pi Lock will make tech crew more efficient by allowing the tech crew members to enter without
Mrs. Steets physical presence, which will increase productivity and rationale. It is also safe, 
and be added to the existing doors without affecting its current functionality. It also increases safety; 
instead of always being unlocked during school events, it can be locked by default, but able to opened by tech crew members 
Mrs Steets approves. She will also be able to see whom is doing this. The Pi Lock will also be allergen free.
